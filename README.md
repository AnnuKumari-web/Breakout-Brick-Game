# Breakout-Brick-Game

In the 2D Breakout game, you need to break all the bricks using a bouncing ball, a ball that you need to prevent from leaving the game area using the paddle.

The player has 3 lives, when he loses a life, we reset the ball position and give him a chance to continue playing, when he loses all the 3 lives, it's a game over, we show him a game over message, and a "play again" button to play over.

To win the game, the player has to break all the bricks on each level, and he has to complete 3 levels, when he passes from a level to another, the number of bricks increases and also the speed of the ball.
